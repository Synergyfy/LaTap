        question: "What is VemTap?",
        answer: "VemTap is a visitor engagement platform that uses NFC technology to bridge the offline-to-online gap. It allows businesses to capture visitor data, manage contacts, and run automated marketing campaigns."
      },
      {
        question: "How does NFC capture work?",
        answer: "NFC (Near Field Communication) allows users to tap their smartphone against a VemTap device. This action instantly opens a capture form or landing page without requiring an app. The visitor enters their details, which are immediately saved to your dashboard."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I navigate the dashboard?",
        answer: "The dashboard is divided into key sections: 'Home' for an overview, 'Contacts' for your visitor database, 'Campaigns' for messaging, 'Devices' for managing hardware, and 'Settings' for account configuration. You can access these from the sidebar menu."

        question: "How do I send a campaign?",
        answer: "To send a campaign: 1. Navigate to the 'Campaigns' tab. 2. Click 'New Campaign'. 3. Select your audience (e.g., 'All Visitors' or a specific segment). 4. Draft your SMS or Email message. 5. Schedule it for later or send immediately."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I manage contacts?",
        answer: "Go to the 'Contacts' page to view all captured leads. You can filter them by date, device source, or tags. Click on a contact to view their history, add notes, or edit their details."

    category: "Surveys and Feedback",
    topics: [
      {
        question: "How do I create a feedback form?",
        answer: "Go to 'Forms & Surveys' in the dashboard. Click 'Create New Form', select the 'Feedback' template, customize your questions (star ratings, text fields), and save. You can then link this form to an NFC device."
      },
      {
        question: "Where can I view survey results?",
        answer: "Survey responses are available in the 'Analytics' section under 'Feedback'. You can see aggregated scores and read individual comments."

    category: "Account Management",
    topics: [
      {
        question: "How do I set up my account?",
        answer: "After signing up, complete your profile in 'Settings > Business Profile'. Upload your logo, set your brand colors, and configure your timezone. Then, link your first NFC device to start capturing data."
      },
      {
        question: "How does billing work?",
        answer: "We offer Free, Basic, and Premium plans. You can view your current plan and invoices in 'Settings > Billing'. Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually."

    category: "Troubleshooting",
    topics: [
      {
        question: "My NFC device is not working",
        answer: "1. Ensure the phone's NFC is turned on (usually in Settings > Connections). 2. Make sure the phone is unlocked. 3. Tap the top-center of the phone (iPhone) or center/back (Android) against the device. 4. If it still fails, check if the device URL is correctly configured in your dashboard."
      },
      {
        question: "Messages are failing to send",
        answer: "Check your 'Credits' balance in 'Settings > Billing'. If you have sufficient credits, verify that the recipient numbers are valid and include the country code. If the issue persists, contact support."
