##  **Use Dynamic NFC Links**

**What it is:**  
 Instead of encoding the actual final URL into the NFC chip, you encode a **short, fixed URL that points to a server** you control. The server then **redirects to the real page**.

**How it works in practice:**

1. The NFC chip stores:  
    `https://tap.yourplatform.com/abc123`

2. When a customer taps, the phone opens this URL.

3. Your server checks which business this NFC belongs to and redirects to:

   * Business A: `https://platform.com/business-a/form`

   * Business B (later): `https://platform.com/business-b/form`

**Result:**

* You can **change the target link anytime** without touching the NFC chip.

* One NFC plate can serve **multiple businesses over its lifetime**.
