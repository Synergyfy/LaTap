Phase 1: The Core Experience (MVP)
Focus: Getting the tap to work and capturing data.

Dynamic NFC Routing Engine:

Develop the "Short URL" redirector ($tap.platform.com/id$) that allows you to link physical hardware to specific business profiles remotely.

The "No-App" Visitor Journey:

Welcome Screen: Business-branded landing page.

Smart Form: High-speed data entry for Name, Phone, and Email (with auto-fill support).

Consent Management: A simple "I Agree" toggle for privacy compliance.

Unique Identity Logic:

System to recognize returning visitors by phone number and increment visit counts instead of creating duplicate profiles.

Basic Business Dashboard:

Secure login/registration.

Visitor list view with search and CSV export.

Essential analytics (Total vs. New vs. Repeat visitors).

Phase 2: Communication & Retention
Focus: Helping businesses use the data they’ve collected.

Multi-Channel Messaging:

Integration with SMS, WhatsApp, and Email gateways.

Campaign builder to send promotions to specific groups (e.g., "Only new visitors").

Loyalty Engine:

Points-per-visit tracking.

Digital coupon generation (Success Screen rewards).

Staff verification portal to "mark as used" when a customer redeems a reward.

Advanced Analytics:

Footfall heatmaps (Peak hours/Slow days).

Message conversion tracking (Did they come back after the SMS?).

Phase 3: Hardware & Account Management
Focus: Scaling the business operations.

Device Management System (DMS):

Centralized portal to track which NFC plate is at which shop.

Remote "Kill Switch" to disable tags if a business stops paying.

Automated Billing & Plans:

Tiered subscription levels (Free/Basic/Premium).

Payment gateway integration for automated renewals and invoicing.

Staff & Role Management:

Allow business owners to invite "Staff" accounts with restricted view-only access.

Phase 4: Optimization & Integration
Focus: Efficiency and ecosystem growth.

Integration Layer:

Public API to connect with external POS (Point of Sale) or CRM systems.

Performance Tuning:

Aggressive caching and data minimization to ensure the <3 second load time in low-network areas.

Company Super-Admin Panel:

Global dashboard for your team to monitor total platform revenue, active businesses, and support tickets.
