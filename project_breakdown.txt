Phase 1: The Core Experience (MVP)

Dynamic NFC Routing Engine:

Develop the "Short URL" redirector ($tap.platform.com/id$) that allows you to link physical hardware to specific business profiles remotely.

The "No-App" Visitor Journey:

Welcome Screen: Business-branded landing page.

Smart Form: High-speed data entry for Name, Phone, and Email (with auto-fill support).

Consent Management: A simple "I Agree" toggle for privacy compliance.

Unique Identity Logic:

System to recognize returning visitors by phone number and increment visit counts instead of creating duplicate profiles.

Basic Business Dashboard:

Secure login/registration.

Visitor list view with search and CSV export.

Essential analytics (Total vs. New vs. Repeat visitors).

Phase 2: Communication & Retention
Focus: Helping businesses use the data they’ve collected.

Multi-Channel Messaging:

Integration with SMS, WhatsApp, and Email gateways.

Campaign builder to send promotions to specific groups (e.g., "Only new visitors").

Loyalty Engine:

Digital coupon generation (Success Screen rewards).

Staff verification portal to "mark as used" when a customer redeems a reward.

Advanced Analytics:

Footfall heatmaps (Peak hours/Slow days).

Message conversion tracking (Did they come back after the SMS?).

Phase 3: Hardware & Account Management
Focus: Scaling the business operations.

Device Management System (DMS):

Centralized portal to track which NFC plate is at which shop.

Remote "Kill Switch" to disable tags if a business stops paying.

Automated Billing & Plans:

Tiered subscription levels (Free/Basic/Premium).

Payment gateway integration for automated renewals and invoicing.

Staff & Role Management:

Allow business owners to invite "Staff" accounts with restricted view-only access.

Phase 4: Optimization & Integration
Focus: Efficiency and ecosystem growth.

Integration Layer:

Public API to connect with external POS (Point of Sale) or CRM systems.

Performance Tuning:

Aggressive caching and data minimization to ensure the <3 second load time in low-network areas.

Company Super-Admin Panel:

Global dashboard for your team to monitor total platform revenue, active businesses, and support tickets.

STEP 1: The 5-Second Core Flow (Non-Negotiable)

Customer taps NFC →

Auto-filled form appears →

✔ Consent
✔ Submit

Done.

- No reviews.
- No surveys.
- No social.
- No distractions.

Target: 3–4 seconds.

That’s your foundation.
[7:22 PM, 2/12/2026] Oyelakin Tobiloba: STEP 2: After Submission (Micro Decision Screen)

Immediately after successful submission:

Show:

✅ Visit recorded successfully.

Would you like to:

⭐ Leave a review
📱 Follow us
📝 Give quick feedback
🎁 Claim rewards

If customer ignores → no problem.
They can walk away.

If they tap something → engagement begins.

This keeps friction low.
[7:23 PM, 2/12/2026] Oyelakin Tobiloba: STEP 3: Automated Post-Visit Engagement

Now here is the powerful part.

Because you already captured:

- Name
- Phone
- Email

You can automate everything later.

🟡 A. Review Automation (Later)

System sends:

SMS / WhatsApp / Email:

“Thanks for visiting [Business Name].
We’d love your feedback.”

With direct Google review link.

This increases reviews without slowing in-store flow.

🟡 B. Social Growth Automation

Message can include:

- Instagram link
- TikTok link
- WhatsApp link
- Website link

Let them engage when relaxed at home.

Higher success rate.

🟡 C. Survey / Feedback System (Very Important)

This is where you build real value.

Businesses need:

- Customer satisfaction data
- Product feedback
- Complaint capture
- Improvement ideas

You create:
- Surve…TEP 4: Smart Engagement Logic

Inside VemTap backend:

Business sets rules:

After visit:
☑ Send review link after 2 hours
☑ Send survey after 24 hours
☑ Send promo after 7 days


Now VemTap becomes:
- A Customer Growth Engine.
Not just NFC.

🔥 Advanced Layer
- Behavior-Based Automation

If customer:
- Leaves 5-star review → send reward coupon
- Leaves low rating → trigger private feedback flow
- Doesn’t respond → resend reminder
- Visits 3 times → send loyalty
